The assessment and control of occupational risks are of great importance; it is the key to managing work risks, which contributes to protecting workers from occupational injuries and diseases, thus reducing hours of absence from work. It also meets the statutory requirements of the relevant authorities. All of this leads to raising productivity and increasing job satisfaction. First: Occupational Risk Assessment Stages: Hazard Identification Stage: Hazard is anything that can or may cause injuries or diseases to workers or damage to the facility or the environment, such as electricity, machines, forklifts, etc. Risk Identification Stage: Risk is the extent to which these hazards may occur (low, medium, high) and the degree of their severity (limited, dangerous, fatal).

Elimination is considered one of the best methods of controlling haz- ards. Reduction It is by reducing exposure periods (Duration), limiting exposure times (Frequency), or substituting materials with less dangerous ones. Engineering Control By setting up and installing ventilation systems to protect workers - in some cases - and performing adequate maintenance of equipment. Administrative Control By changing the method of work, rotating jobs, cleaning and arranging work sites, activating permit to work systems (PTW), training employees, and providing the required prevention and protection tools for workers.

In other words, Ergonomics is the science, which focuses on studying the relationship between the worker and the machine and the work environment in which he works so that the worker can perform his work with the least possible amount of hazards and risks that may arise from the machine and the work environment. This science has emerged and there has been growing interest in it after noticing that many occupational diseases have occurred as a result of the inappropriateness of the machine with the human being, in addition to many neurological, orthopedic and spinal injuries. Ergonomics is concerned with design to achieve the desired goals and objectives for three factors: Designs for Work Environments, Designs for Workers, and Designs for Used Equipment and Machines.

Fire extinguishers weighing 18 kg (40 lbs.) and less shall be hung at a height of 1.5 m (5 ft). Fire extinguishers weighing more than 18 kg (40 lbs.) shall be hung at a height of 1.07 m (3.5 ft.) The distance between the base of the extinguisher and the floor shall not be less than 10 cm (4 inches). Fire Extinguishers Distribution Specifications: Before distributing fire extinguishers and determining their number, the potential risks shall be known. The types of risks are classified into three categories: Light risks: The places that have small amounts of flammable solids or small quantities of flammable materials such as photocopier inks. These places include schools, offices and places of wor - ship. Medium risk: The places that have quantities of flammable solids and more flammable materials than places where there are light risks. Examples of these p", "de schools, offices and places of wor - ship. Medium risk: The places that have quantities of flammable solids and more flammable materials than places where there are light risks. Examples of these places are dining halls, car show - rooms and commercial markets. Severe risks: The places that have storage quantities of flammable solids and flammable materials, where it is expected that with this volume of materials the fire will spread quickly in the event of a fire. Distribution of Class A fire extinguishers: The type of risks in a place shall be classified (light - medium - severe) and then the area to be protected is determined. Schedule (6) below shall be guided by. The estimated distance from the place of the fire to the location of the fire extinguisher shall not, in any case, exceed 23 m (75 ft). Schedule 6: fire extinguishing equipment distribution guide of fire Class (A) Fire Extinguishing Equipment CapacityMax Estimated Distance The space that the equipment is defined to protect (ft2) Light risks Medium risks Severe risks", "BASIC STANDARDS FOR OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY & HEALTH (OSH)73If the space of the place to be protected is less than 279 m2 (3000 f eet), the place shall be provided with fire extinguishing equipment of the smallest size (2A). If the shape of the land area is circular, its radius equals 23 m2 (75 ft2) and has no obstacles, one fire extinguishing equipment can be put in the middle and in this case, you can protect an area estimates 17700 ft2 by using fire extinguisher suits the existing risks in the location. If the shape of the land area is rectangular, the largest area of a square that can be drawn in which any point in it can’t be far from 23 m2 (75 ft2) shall be 11250 ft2 (1045 m2) and the side length of this square is nearly 106 ft2 drawn inside the circle which its radius equals 75 ft2. Therefore, it is obvious that the largest area that can be protected by fire extinguishing equipment without violation of the estimated distance condition is 11250 ft2.

Solution: The largest area that can be covered by the fire extinguisher is 11250 ft2 and by dividing the building area on this area equals the number of fire extinguishers (67500÷11250= 6 fire ex - tinguishers). According to the Schedule 6, the simple risk requires 6 fire extinguishers (Class 4A), the medium risk requires 6 fire extinguishers (Class 10A) and the severe risk requires 6 fire extinguishers (Class 20A). Fire Extinguishers distribution of Class B: Class B Fires can be classified into two groups: Flammable liquid fires which its depth is less than 0.635 cm (1/4 inch). Burning liquid fires are more than 0.635 cm. The General Rule of fire extinguishers distribution of Class B is that the more fire extinguish- ers are closer to the risk place, the more it is better.

Ensure getting all individuals in the location off. Stand on a distance estimated 2 to 3 meters from the fire location. Stand in the wind direction in case of air currents. Ensure that the fire extinguisher suits the fire Class to avoid larger damages. How to use the fire extinguisher: Pull a safety clip that exists in the handle. Test the fire extinguisher to check its validity by pressing once on the handle, then go to the fire location. Hold the fire extinguisher by one hand and the hose end by the other.

It comprises government, employers and workers’ organisations of the 187 member countries. The ILO is aiming at setting standards and work policies to raise the concept of decent work all over the world. Since its establishment, the ILO has issued 189 conventions and 204 recommendations, for the improvement of work conditions and circumstances. Also, it works to achieve the goals of decent work. All of these put the principles of Occupational Health and Safety (OSH) as a main important point to minimise the occurrence of accidents and diseases at workplaces. Moreover, it works to provide better protection for workers from hazards that may arise from a disadvantageous workplace. The ILO has also issued guidelines on occupational safety and health management system ILO-OSH 2001, which aims at protecting the workers, upgrading their health status, and achieving better health and safety levels at workplace with definite responsibilities of the tripartite constituents. From", "001, which aims at protecting the workers, upgrading their health status, and achieving better health and safety levels at workplace with definite responsibilities of the tripartite constituents. From these concepts, the idea of developing this manual came as a contribution from the ILO Cairo Office to highlight the importance of adopting OSH management system on the workplace, to improve the working environment and mitigate the workplace hazards and associated risks. The manual also, is highlighting a layout for an effective OSH department in the enterprises through the application of risk assessment and emergency plan. It also encourages the compliance with the national OSH regulations. I seize this opportunity to thank the project team for their exerted efforts in preparing this manual. Wishing these efforts can contribute in raising the management and workers awareness on the importance of OSH principles. Which will help improving the productivity levels and guaranteeing a secured work environment.

century BC, issued laws to protect the safety of workers, including the following: ⚫ If a builder build a house for someone, and does not construct it properly, and the house which he built fall in and kill its owner, then that builder shall be put to death. ⚫ Punishment of the supervisors who cause damage as a result of failure to perform their work in a proper manner, for example, if a worker loses his arm as a result of the error or negligence of the supervisor, the supervisor’s arm has to be cut likewise. Ancient Egyptians recorded laws regarding the number of working hours and the rest periods for the workers in building the pyramids and providing hot meals for them. They also defined some diseases arising from certain industries and laid down a comprehensive description of the diseases that afflicted the workers in sharpening weapons as a result of inhaling the flying dust as weapons were made at that time from granite, as well as the workers in the granite quarrie", "n of the diseases that afflicted the workers in sharpening weapons as a result of inhaling the flying dust as weapons were made at that time from granite, as well as the workers in the granite quarries, who sculpted the Pharaohs obelisks. In 400 BC, Hippocrates observed in ancient Greece for the first time that workers in mercury sulfide were suffering from illness. In the 1540s, Barracelios, in Austria, gave a description of pulmonary disease among mining workers. In Bohemia in 1556, Agricola wrote (De Re Metallica) describing the diseases spread among the mining workers as well as the use of ventilation and the protective equipment for the respiratory system to control exposure to gases and dust.Introduction", "Occupational Safety and Health Management System 10 Ramatsena (father of industrial medicine) and professor of medicine in Padua introduced (De Morbis Artificum Diatriba), which was the first study to be conducted on industrial diseases, and Ramatsena was the one who added to the list of questions prepared by Hippocrates for patients when recording their history, the question about the quality of work. John Stanhaos presented in1858 the first mask impregnated with coal to control exposure to gases and vapors. In the United Kingdom, labor and safety laws have begun to be issued since 1802, and in 1833 an entity was formed to inspect the factories (HM Factory Inspectorate) in order to inspect factories and ensure the prevention of occupational accidents of child laborers in textile sector. In 1840, the Royal Commission published a report on the status of the workers in the mining industry, which documented the high ratio of horrific accidents in this sector, as well as the hazardous and non-secure work environment, that infuriated the wide public and paved the way for the issuance of the Law of Mines in 1844, which has resulted in many prosecutions, and forced the mine owners to impr", "non-secure work environment, that infuriated the wide public and paved the way for the issuance of the Law of Mines in 1844, which has resulted in many prosecutions, and forced the mine owners to improve the working environment and largely reduce accidents. In 1889, limits were laid down concerning the exposure to moisture and carbon dioxide in the cotton factories in the United Kingdom. In Germany, Bismarck (Otto von Bismarck) launched the first social insurance legislation in 1883 and the Workers’ Compensation Act in 1884 in response to the demands of workers for the first time in Europe, and was followed by other European countries. During World War I (1914-1918) the urgent need to work in ammunition plants led to the deterioration of working conditions, and as a result a committee for the health of labors in ammunition factories was formed and laid down the basis for many of the following practices in the science of human engineering, psychology, welfare, and working systems by shifts.

Number of industrial health organizations increased in the United States during World War II to support the war effort. In 1953, the British Occupational Health Society (BOHS) was founded and began to publish annual periodics on occupational health in 1958. In 1970 President Nixon signed the Occupational Safety and Health Act as the Congress created Occupational Safety and Health Agency (OSHA) under the Ministry of Labor in order to ensure the safety and health of the working conditions for both men and women workers, through setting and applying standards and providing training, awareness-raising, education, and assistance.

In 1978 the Agency began the implementation of donor programs, which are now called (Susan Harwood training grant program), which is a training grant to train workers and employers in reducing the risks in working places,. In 1982 OSHA began the implementation of the voluntary protection programs, which allows employers to apply “workplace model “ for certification if it was compatible with the occupational safety and health management system requirements (OHSAS 18001).", "Occupational Safety and Health Management System 12Definitions and Terminology The risk any event, activity or unplanned change that happens in the work environment and lead to injuries, illnesses or deaths.

Occupational Health and Safety Management System A network of interrelated elements. These elements include responsibilities, authorities, relationships, jobs, activities, processes, practices, procedures and resources. The management system uses these elements to set the policies, plans, programs, and objectives, and develop ways to implement these policies, plans and programs, and achieve these goals. The procedure A specific way to carry out the activity or process, and the procedure may be documented or not. It describes documented regulators of a process or activity, including the related inputs and outputs.

It aims to improve the working conditions and the surrounding environment. Occupational health includes promoting and maintaining the highest degree of physical and mental health and social well-being of workers in all professions. In this context, the basic principles of the process of assessing and managing occupational hazards is based on the expectation, recognition, evaluation and control of the risks arising in or from the workplace and that are harmful to the health and well-being of workers. The potential impact on the surrounding communities and the general environment should be also taken into consideration. The basic process of learning about the reduction of risks and dangers are derived of the roots of more complex principles that control the occupational health and safety today. It was the need to master the growing industrialization in the present day, and its demand ", "s are derived of the roots of more complex principles that control the occupational health and safety today. It was the need to master the growing industrialization in the present day, and its demand to provide energy sources that are dangerous in nature, such as the use of nuclear energy, and the transportation systems and complex technologies that resulted in a better development of the methods of risk assessment and management. Balance must be achieved in all areas of human activity between the benefits and costs of risk. But, in the case of occupational safety and health, this complex balance is influenced by many factors such as the speed of scientific and technological progress, the world of diverse and constantly changing work, and the economy. Application of occupational health and safety principles, which includes the mobilization of all social and scientific disciplines, constitutes a clear measurement of this complexity. Occupational health and safety is considered an important global issue as it is one of the decisive factors in the industrial and agricultural development taking place in the developing countries. Economically, there are direct and indirect costs as a re", "ant global issue as it is one of the decisive factors in the industrial and agricultural development taking place in the developing countries. Economically, there are direct and indirect costs as a result of the ineffectiveness of the occupational health and safety system, including, for example: ⚫ The cost of treatment. ⚫ Decrease in the number of working days ⚫ Low productivity ⚫ Compensation costs ⚫ Training and re-training costs ⚫ Repairing the equipment damages costs ⚫ Loss of contracts because the product does not meet the specifications. According to the International Labor Organization statistics (ILO), the 250 million workers around the world are exposed to accidents each year due to problems in securing the work environment, and more than 160 million workers are already injured, while 1.2 million workers yearly die as a result of accidents or diseases in their workplace while carrying out their work. Therefore, it is now understood that these direct and indirect costs reduce the competitiveness and economic welfare of states, and could be simply avoided through the application of the occupational safety and health management system in the work environment by a long-term c", "the competitiveness and economic welfare of states, and could be simply avoided through the application of the occupational safety and health management system in the work environment by a long-term commitment of all interested parties. Risks of occupational health and safety are risks that threaten the sustainability of the business and its ability to sustain.", "Occupational Safety and Health Management System 14Identification of risk and its sources in the work environment The main objective of the application of occupational safety and health management system is to prevent accidents and diseases from occurring. To achieve this goal, we must focus on the identification of risk and measure both the severity of the risk and its rates of recurrence. The concepts of risks and hazards and their interrelation can easily lead to significant confusion. a hazard is a potential or substantial property of a process, product or case that may cause damage or leave harmful health effects on people or damage things. It can result from a chemical substance (substantial property), working on the stairs (case), electricity, a compressed gas cylinder (potential energy), a fire source, or simply a slipper floor. Risk is the possibility for a person to suffer injury or to experience adverse health effects resulting from exposure to the hazard, or his property to be damageed or lost. The relationship between hazards and risks is a matter of exposure whether on short or long term. Risks are divided into four sections: First: Risk that appears on the long term ", " be damageed or lost. The relationship between hazards and risks is a matter of exposure whether on short or long term. Risks are divided into four sections: First: Risk that appears on the long term Chemical risk Health risks arise as a result of exposure to a variety of chemicals, some of which are toxic, others lead to burns from their contact with the body, and other damage may occur as a result of inhalation of chemical vapors. The pores of the skin or wounds may absorb some of the chemicals, or through contamination of some food with chemicals. Part V of the work law No. 12 for the year 2003 provides that: (Article No. 211) The establishment and its branches shall provide means of protection from chemical risks resulting from dealing with solid, liquid and gaseous chemicals, subject to the following: • The highest concentration permissible in the chemical materials and the cancer causing materials to which the workers are exposed shall not be exceeded. • The dangerous chemical materials stock shall not exceed the threshold quantities for each of them. • Providing the necessary precautions for protecting the establishment and workers on transporting, storing, handling and usin", "terials stock shall not exceed the threshold quantities for each of them. • Providing the necessary precautions for protecting the establishment and workers on transporting, storing, handling and using the dangerous chemicals and disposing of their waste. • Keeping a register for limiting the dangerous chemical materials being handled, comprising all data concerning each material, and a register for recording the status of work environment and exposure of the workers to the danger of chemicals. • Placing labels for recognizing all chemical materials being handled at work, and indicating their scientific and trade name, their chemical composition, the degree of dangerousness, the safety precautions, and the relevant emergency procedures. The establishment shall obtain the data mentioned in these materials from the suppliers upon supplying them. • Training the workers in dealing with the dangerous chemical materials and the cancer causing substances and enlightening and acquainting them with their risks and with the methods of safety and protection from these dangers.", "An applied and training guide for medium and large companies 15Chemical materials state of matter: 1. liquid: organic solvents- acids- paints- detergent liquid- liquid pesticides, which enter through skin absorption, ingestion or injection. 2. Solid: dusts of chemical materials as pesticides and dust of industrial processes such as cement and asbestos, which enter through the nose or mouth. 3. Gaseous: vapors, fumes and metal gases generated by welding metal, and the evaporation, burning, and reaction of the chemical materials due to misuse, storage or outputs from work processes (gas, steaming, splashes ...), which enter through the respiratory system. Chemicals may enter the human body through four ways: ⚫ Inhalation: It includes gases, vapors, dusts and fumes which are the most common. ⚫ Absorption through the skin and eyes: It is the second most common way. Although the skin is a defensive barrier, but there are some materials that can penetrate the skin and eyes and access the circulatory system. There are factors that help to increase the absorption such as high temperature and the existence of open wounds in the skin. ⚫ Ingestion : chemicals enter by this way to the digestiv", "culatory system. There are factors that help to increase the absorption such as high temperature and the existence of open wounds in the skin. ⚫ Ingestion : chemicals enter by this way to the digestive system due to a lack of personal hygiene or during lunch. Hence, it is necessary for the facility to keep organized records of the documents of Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) showing the nature of the material used, its danger, sound methods of usage, storage and handling conditions and ways. Biological risk Workers are exposed in the medical facilities to this type of dangers more than others in terms of waste. Wastes from hospitals and health institutions are among the most dangerous and most important sources of biological risk because such waste is an ideal and fertile environment for the growth of the fiercest microbes, viruses, and fungi, which are transmitted to the workers in hospitals through inhalation, tactile, and all the other ways of exposures, thus these wastes must be identified in terms of components, places of their growth, how to deal with them, and the right ways to get rid of them without causing any pollution to the external environment.

Once completed from the row map it will be dependence this map by the matching with the reality from the committee and all the members of committee will Signing on the matching. Secondly: Measuring the relative weight of risk separate any process that was clear in the flow institution map and classify the dangerous types according to the occupational health and safety management system to the mechanic or biology or physics or chemical or fire danger where is must be measuring the relative weight of risk and rang this between: Weak danger = 1 Average danger = 2 Strong danger =3", "Occupational Safety and Health Management System 30The heaviest weight is given to the rate of repetition in danger as the: Weak rate of repetition= 1 Average rate of repetition=2 Strong rate of repetition= 3 Therefore the total amount the intensity of the danger × the repetition rate = the dangerous relative weight and this result will make us too took the action about controlling in this risks Example (1) Any fire danger in any institution the intensity of the danger =3 (a strong danger destroy everything and lead to death and burning) But the rate in danger repetition is a weak =1 (because this risk not repeated daily, monthly, and may be happened on a separated period sometimes may reach to a years) And thus the danger relative rate of the fire =3×1 = 3 And so the protect actions that will follow to faced this type of danger will not be daily or weekly but it will be quarterly or a half-yearly. Example (2) The danger that a worker faced it (the clipper………….._) when cut fabrics using electric clipper, when evaluate this danger we must ask that danger as a weak or average or strong but we discover here that the answer is a strong danger it can lead to a cut in the hand or fingers", "g electric clipper, when evaluate this danger we must ask that danger as a weak or average or strong but we discover here that the answer is a strong danger it can lead to a cut in the hand or fingers or severe wounds and thus The intensity of the danger = 3 but the repetition rate of danger is a highly = 3 ( because this danger is a repeated every day and may be more than once) Thus the danger relative rate of the fire=3×3= 9 And thus will be make the protect actions that follow to faced this type of danger will be daily. Thirdly, risk control Risk control means reducing or preventing the risk in order to protect workers and improve the working environment conditions, and to ensure its effectiveness five conditions has to be achieved: 1. There needs to be sufficient risk control to eliminate or reduce risk whenever possible. 2. providing protection for all workers that are more likely to be at risk. 3.

Second point: control between the danger source and the worker through: ⚫ higher quality levels of supervision and training. ⚫ using clear working instructions for equipment. ⚫ use of warning posters. Third point: control at the workers themselves by taking precautionary measures and fully equipping them with protective gear. Example (3) If so happens that a worker suffered from food poisoning from the facility’s cantina, in this case, the suggested control could be a set of simultaneous procedures for improving the applied kitchen sanitation and food preserving plans, for individuals working inside the cantina, or for the food preparation equipment or the food resources itself, as well as having the kitchen employees well trained at their work, performing precautionary maintenance on fridges and calibrating the temperature measurement devices.
